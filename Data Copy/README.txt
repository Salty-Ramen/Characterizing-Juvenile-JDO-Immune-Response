This folder contains copies of all the files provided to me by Lauren.

These copies have extra sheets in them wherein I've made a more code friendly version of the tables provided.


Comments:

The female body weight data is interesting. Mice 1 through 15 have weights upto day 7, despite being labelled as day 0. The presentation here looks different from what male data is. Need some clarity.

The formula for calculating avg BAL protein is different in the excel sheets for male and female data. Need more clarity. Female data also doesn't have BAL cell counts.

The list of columns:

ID
Day
Sex
Bioplex (Cytokines) x 23 - bioplex
BAL cell counts - Correlation
BAL proteins - Correlation
Body weight - Master_ID
Hysteresis - Corrrelation
Viral Burden - Correlation


All the data comes from sheets names starting with "Data_Reordered".
